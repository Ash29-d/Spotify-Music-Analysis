# Spotify-Music-Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Spotify data using Power BI to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in music streaming. The dashboard provides a visual representation of metrics such as popular tracks, artists, genres, user engagement, and streaming behavior over time. It is designed to assist users, artists, or marketers in making data-driven decisions.


## Features
  
   * Interactive Dashboards:
       
       * Visualize top artists, albums, and tracks based on user preferences and streaming counts.
         Analyze trends in genres, listener activity, and regional performance.
   
   * Insights into Streaming Habits:
        * Identify peak streaming hours and popular listening times.
        * Explore correlations between playlist additions and song popularity.
  
   * Data Exploration:
        * Filter and drill down into specific time periods, regions, or user demographics.
  
   *  Custom Metrics:
        * Custom KPIs such as "Most Streamed Genre" or "Top Listener Demographics."

## How It Works
 
   * Data Transformation:
      * Use Power BI's Power Query to preprocess and model the data.
      * Create relationships between datasets such as user activity, track metadata, and playlist details.

   * Dashboard Development:
      * Design visualizations for key metrics using Power BI visuals (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, maps).
      * Apply filters and slicers for dynamic user interaction.
